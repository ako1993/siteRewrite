        Hello! My name is Andreas and I am a stand up comedian currently living in the Pittsburgh area.<br>
        I've been performing stand up comedy for about six years now and have loved every minute of it!<br>
        During that time, I have performed at almost every type of venue one can possibly imagine!<br>
        I've performed at comedy clubs, firehalls, nursing homes, memorials, swingers clubs, breweries,<br>
        a boxing gym, wineries, a tattoo parlor, a library, several movie theaters, street corners, the bed of trucks<br>
        and a bunch of other places I genuinely cannot remember right now. In summation, I've done a lot of comedy<br>
        in a lot of different places, and I want to perform for you next! You're most likely here because<br>
        You saw me perform at a show or you saw some of my content on social media. If you would like to <br>
        book me for an event or private party, it's as easy as clicking the "book me" link at the top of<br>
        this page and filling out the information on the form. If you just want to see more of my work,<br>
        feel free to check out some of my stuff below! I update this page regularly!
